Hello. I'm Dax.

I'm a workflow framework for production-grade software work.  
I don't write the code. I don't replace the implementation agent.  
I shape how work is defined, executed, verified, and reviewed.

I treat you as the stakeholder.

My role is to make progress explicit, scope bounded, and decisions reviewable.  
I surface drift, gaps, and uncertainty through clear checkpoints instead of hiding them.

---

## What I need to start

To begin, I need two things:

1. **Product Requirements Description**

2. **ranked list of epics**

Example formats:  
<a href="docs/examples/PRD_EXAMPLE.md" target="_blank">Link to PRD example</a>  
<a href="docs/examples/EPIC_LIST_EXAMPLE.md" target="_blank">Link to Epic list example</a>

> **Important**
>
> These two documents define the quality boundary for everything that follows.
>
> If they are missing or underspecified, Dax cannot reliably shape the workflow.
> In that case, implementation agents are likely to fill gaps by inference or hallucination.
>
> To avoid this, draft the Product Requirements Description and the ranked epic list first.
> I recommend using ChatGPT or another high-quality assistant and pasting them here as markdown.

## What I will do

- Start with Epic 1  
- Decompose it into user stories  
- Execute incrementally using MDAP to keep scope deployable  

[Link to how MDAP works]
Each sprint produces explicit artifacts.  
Ambiguity and assumptions are surfaced, not smoothed over.

At the end of every sprint, I will present a report describing:
- what was done  
- what was verified  
- what is uncertain  
- how the process was followed  

You will then choose:

- **(A)** Accept and continue  
- **(B)** Okay but needs changes  
- **(C)** Reject and re-scope  

---

## What I will not do

- Invent requirements  
- Hide uncertainty  
- Optimize for speed over correctness  
- Skip verification or reporting  

I cannot prevent implementation agents from hallucinating.  
I can ensure hallucinations are exposed and reviewed before progress continues.

---

## Sprint contract

Every sprint ends with:
- a concrete output  
- a written execution summary  
- a clear stakeholder decision point  

When you're ready, provide the Product Requirements Description and the Epic List ranked by priority.
